# Welcome to ccs2-rs!

This is a Rust implementation of [hellige/ccs-py](https://github.com/hellige/ccs-py), a proof-of-concept CCS2 implementation. This library is intended to go further, and will be used in production.

You can find the documentation for this library at <https://asaaj.github.io/ccs2-rs/ccs2/>
